## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
We propose a Smart Crop Advisory System that leverages AI, IoT, and mobile technology to provide personalized and real-time crop guidance for small and marginal farmers. Detailed explanation of the proposed solution

Soil and Weather Analysis Integration with IoT sensors or manual input for soil pH, moisture, and nutrients. Real-time weather forecasts for irrigation and crop protection.
Crop Recommendation Engine AI-based suggestions for suitable crops based on soil type, season, and market demand.
Fertilizer and Pesticide Advisory Timely notifications for fertilizer dosage and eco-friendly pest management.
Irrigation Management Smart scheduling based on rainfall prediction and soil moisture data.
Market Linkage & Price Alerts Market price prediction and direct connection with buyers to increase profits.
Multi-language Support Mobile app/IVR system in local languages for accessibility.
How it addresses the problem the system addresses the challenges faced by small and marginal farmers by providing personalized, data-driven crop advisory. Farmers often lack access to expert guidance, leading to poor crop selection and low yields. Our system uses soil data, weather forecasts, and AI models to recommend suitable crops, fertilizers, irrigation schedules, and pest control measures. Information is delivered in local languages via mobile app/SMS/IVR, ensuring accessibility even to farmers without smartphones. This ensures timely, reliable, and affordable decision support to increase productivity and reduce risks.

Innovation and uniqueness of the solution Localized & Inclusive: Unlike generic apps, it supports local languages and works with SMS/IVR for non-smartphone users. Low-cost IoT integration: Soil moisture, rainfall, and temperature sensors can be cheaply deployed, but manual input is also supported for affordability. AI + Market Linkage: The system not only gives crop/fertilizer advice but also provides market price alerts and buyer connections, improving farmer income. Eco-friendly advisory: Suggests organic/natural pest control methods to reduce chemical dependency. Feedback-driven: Learns from farmer feedback to improve accuracy over time.
## Technical Approach
Technologies to be used (e.g. programming languages, frameworks, hardware) Programming Languages: Python (AI/ML), Java/Kotlin (Android App), PHP/Node.js (Backend). Frameworks: TensorFlow/PyTorch (ML models), Flask/Django (API), Firebase (push notifications). Hardware: IoT sensors (optional) for soil moisture & temperature. Databases: MySQL/PostgreSQL for farmer profiles and advisory records. APIs: Weather API (IMD, OpenWeather), Market price APIs.

Methodology and process for implementation Data Collection: Farmer inputs (soil, location, crop preference), weather API data, market prices. Processing: AI/ML models analyze suitability of crops, pest risk, and irrigation needs. Advisory Generation: System generates step-by-step advice for farmers. Delivery: Through Mobile App, SMS, or IVR in local languages. Feedback Loop: Farmer feedback is collected to improve recommendations. ┌───────────────────┐ ┌───────────────────┐ │ Start System │ └───────┬───────────┘ │ ┌─────────▼──────────┐ │ Farmer Inputs Data │ └─────────┬──────────┘ │ ┌─────────▼──────────┐ │ Collect Weather & │ │ Market Data │ └─────────┬──────────┘ │ ┌─────────▼──────────┐ │ AI Crop Advisory │ │ (Crop + Fertilizer │ │ + Irrigation) │ └─────────┬──────────┘ │ ┌─────────▼──────────┐ │ Market Price Alerts │ │ & Pest Warnings │ └─────────┬──────────┘ │ ┌─────────▼──────────┐ │ Send Advice to │ │ Farmer (App/SMS) │ └─────────┬──────────┘ │ ┌───────▼───────────┐ │ End / Feedback │ └───────────────────

## Feasibility and Viability
Analysis of the feasibility of the idea

Easy to implement using existing weather APIs and soil data. Works even without sensors (manual input possible). Uses low-cost mobile communication (SMS/IVR).

Potential challenges and risks Limited smartphone penetration among marginal farmers. Internet connectivity issues in rural areas. Initial mistrust of AI-driven advisory.

Strategies for overcoming these challenges Support for SMS/IVR ensures accessibility. Offline mode for mobile app. Awareness campaigns & government partnerships to build trust. Subsidized IoT devices through farmer producer organizations (FPOs).
## Impact and Benefits
Potential impact on the target audience: Empowers small and marginal farmers with scientific farming practices. Increases crop yield and reduces cost of inputs. Improves farmer income by connecting to markets.

Benefits of the solution Social: Reduces farmer distress and migration by ensuring stable income. Economic: Increases profitability through market awareness and efficient input use. Environmental: Promotes water conservation and organic pest control, reducing chemical impact. Scalability: Can be scaled to millions of farmers with minimal infrastructure.
